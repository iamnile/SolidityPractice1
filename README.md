# SolidityPractice1
This is my solidity practice problem for learning setting and getting variables form the blockchain <br>
Using this project you can learn how to set variables and get variables from your smart conrtract on the blockchain <br>
Copy and Paste this code into the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org">Remix IDE</a>, compile, deploy and test the smart contract on a the Javascript VM or a test network to see how it works. <br>
<br>
Use this as a template to create, set, and get your own variables.
